texture set, but it was still a button
hunt.

In it you had to hunt down 7 buttons
to open 7 doors. This level is what
people consider a "Button Hunt".This
type of level is very disliked in the
SRB2 community.

Castle Eggman first appeared in SRB2 Demo
4.0. It's mostly the same as 1.09.4's 
version except almost all textures are
from Greenflower Zone and all flying
badniks are missing. Back then, Castle
Eggman was unlocked the same way you 
just unlocked it. By collecting all 7
Emeralds.

This is the third earliest released
version of Greenflower Zone. This 
version had a complete texture 
overhaul from when it was seen in
the SAGE 2000 Trailer. The stage was
also extended from its last playable
version seen in SRB2 Christmas 0.93.

Greenflower act 2 introduced several
things to SRB2, such as moving FOFs,
a large level, invulnerability, Speed 
shoes, and water currents.
This early version also had minor 
texture problems that were fixed in
Demo 3, and the slope near the end
did not exist yet.

It was Srb2 version 1.01 that brought us
this next update. Greenflower zone 
received new plants and 2 houses ready 
to be moved into.

Checkpoints were also introduced in this 
version of Greenflower as well as emblems.

filled. A new red spring was added in one
of the early puddles.

Welcome to Hell! Red volcano, before
2.0, was where Red XVI would send players
who jumped on his roof. The level back
then was never compatible with co-op
mode.
Pope Red XVI also references sending you
here when he sends you to "Heaven".

An Extra shield has been placed on the 
lower path to allow Amy to pass the level.

rebuilt and If you have the 7 emeralds,
you best not jump on the closest House 
3 times, or else you'll be, "Sent to hell".
(originally only worked after beating
1.09.4 three times first)

In this version of the map, the puddles
at the start were made deeper due to
an engine update. The diagonal spring 
path was installed near the start of 
the level to give an alternate route
to the Attraction Shield. 

This version also replaced the 
Elemental Shield with the short lived
water Shield.

When this version released it was
intended for SRB2Fun (IRC) visitors 
only. But this version somehow got 
linked to on the Forums and spread far 
enough to hit even Youtube. Regardless, 
this version of the level introduced us 
to the new 2.0 Crawlas.
RedXVI also moved out, probably to
go to Vatican City.

This version of the level only brought
us the new design of SDURF and showed us
the revitalized Elemental Shield.
Things were still in transition from 
1.09.4 to 2.0 at the time so some of the 
old sprites were still in use.

Here, Greenflower Act 1 was modified
to better benefit Time Attack mode.
Both acts had their emblems scrambled
except for a select few. Difficulty 
levels were also removed locking
SRB2 permanently into normal mode.
That is unless you knew the
"ultimate" cheat.

SRB2 Halloween was the first public 
release of SRB2. According to SSNTails, 
coding for SRB2 in Doom Legacy v1.28.
started in Late August, 1999. It 
consisted of only one very basic 
playable level. The level featured use 
of Doom Legacy's water and a 
maze-section comprised of see-through 
bar textures.

This Stage did not pop up until October 
2000, when Sonic Team Jr. went back and 
made the windows compatible version of 
the Tech demo. The differences between 
this stage and the previous stage is 
almost like night and day as act 1 was 
built more like a Doom Map and this act
more like a Sonic stage, thanks to the
efforts of Sonikku.

This is Castle Eggman as it was in

everything seems the same but several 
badniks and items are missing as are all
the castle textures.

At this point, the level didn't even have 
its level slot assigned yet, resulting in 
it having Greenflower's Sky and music.
