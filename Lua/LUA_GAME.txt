/*Camera spawn examples!

These are required if you want your level to have checkpoints.
Make your spawn point and checkpoints trigger a script that's
called CAMHERE#, replace X, Y, and Z with the coordinates you want it
spawned at, and copypaste the template for whatever many checkpoints
you need. Make sure the script can only be activated on respawn!
You can do this by making the trigger for the script also remove
the triggers for the other scripts, such as making triggering
FOFs vertically move out of the way.
